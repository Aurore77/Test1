                    <p>
                        In the early 1990s, a troup of performers coming from South Africa landed in the harbour of Brighton in England. Juggling, fire-breathing and playing mystical music, they started to delight locals and visitors on Brighton Pier.<br />
                        Soon, they draw the attention of Max Dungleberg, one the most important Show Producers in the United Kingdom. M. Dungleberg, decided to offer them to ensure the first part of the Blackpool Tower Circus show. Since in 1990, the Blackpool Tower Circus stopped performing with animals, they were looking for a new concept. <br />
                        In six months, Wild Circus company, began to get well known.<br />
                        After sharing some of their knowledges and ideas with the Blackpool Tower company, Wild Circus troup decided to create its own first show. M. Dungleberg still charmed by the beauty of the mystical performances executed by Wild Circus, decided he would fund this first show "Magical Chikera". And that's how the story begun.

                    <p>
                        Now in its third decade, Wild Circus troup has evolved and grown over the years, in numbers and in spirit. Nowadays, Wild Circus is famous worldwide but the essence of what we created stays the same: provoke your senses and invoke your imagination reminding you we are all children of Mother of Nature.
